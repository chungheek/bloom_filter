# bloom_filter.py

bloom_filter.py is a python script that utilizes the bloom filter data structure and the
class constructed is taken from https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/08/gentle-introduction-bloom-filter.html.
Using this BloomFilter class we add dictionary.txt to the bitarray and we need a sample_input.txt file
and it will tell us if the input in the file are in the bloom filter or not.

Following lines can be changed:
- 9: bit_arr_size
- 10: hash_func_count
- 11: dictionary
- 12: input_f

Need:
- argument for bit_arr_size (preferably greater than size of dictionary)
- argument for hash_func_size (preferably fewer times so less bits are set)
- dictionary file
- input file

In order to run:
- python3 -m venv (arbitrary name of venv)
- source (virtualenv name)/bin/activate
- pip install bitarray
- pip install mmh3
	- OR run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' (given in folder)
- python3 bloom_filter.py

Sample data gathered from playing around with bit array size and hash function count:<br>
|	Bloom Arguments 										|				Results							|
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| bloom = BloomFilter(623518, 10) 		| Doesn't filter						|
| bloom = BloomFilter(623518*2, 10) 	| Doesn't filter						|
| bloom = BloomFilter(623518*3, 10) 	| Filters 3/5 negatives			|
| bloom = BloomFilter(623518 * 6, 10) | Filter works successfully |
| bloom = BloomFilter(623518*3, 50) 	| Doesn't filter						|
| bloom = BloomFilter(623518*6, 9) 		| Filter works successfully |
| bloom = BloomFilter(623518, 1) 			| Filter works successfully |
| bloom = BloomFilter(623518 * 6, 20) | Filters 4/5 negatives			|
